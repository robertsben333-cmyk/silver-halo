The market is pricing in a dilutive equity offering. In small-cap biotech, a 13% drop often precedes a secondary offering as the company 'takes the price' offered by underwriters. High SPI due to the binary nature of biotech cash needs. Shorting is feasible but carries gap-up risk if a partnership is announced unexpectedly.",2026-01-05,24.98,22.675

With a reduced pipeline, the market is discounting the stock toward its cash value. Downside often continues in these names as internal staff departures and liquidations occur. Low QSI reflects loss of investor trust. Borrow is tight but downside momentum is persistent. Main risk is a 'dead cat bounce' on low volume.",2026-01-05,21.82,22.54

The lack of a fundamental earnings base at this valuation makes the $30 level fragile. High Overhang Index from potential secondary offerings. Expect further pressure as the stock lacks a clear buyer of last resort. Short candidate score is high due to the clear momentum break and high volume on the drop.,2026-01-05,34.01,33.045

Microstructure shows heavy late-day selling as retail participants exit positions to avoid further capital erosion. High Shock Persistence due to the underlying need for further financing. Downside continuation is highly likely as the stock searches for a new floor amid thin liquidity. Risk: Low float can lead to volatility spikes.",2026-01-05,147.47,158.6719

Unlike technical drops, guidance cuts often lead to multi-day 'digestion' as institutional models are re-rated. Borrow availability is high, making it a viable short. The Quality and Sentiment Index is falling as the 'growth at any price' narrative fails. Downside likely to persist toward the next support level near $25.

The SPI is moderate as the firm still maintains core operations, but the MPI is high due to the lack of liquidity during the drop. Downside may continue if the sell-off is part of a multi-day rebalancing act. Uncertainty is high due to limited public filings regarding the specific driver.",2026-01-05,184.43,193.0
20260105_113654,2026-01-05T11:36:54.000000,RDVT,46.0,4.6,7,Technical Breakdown,"Stock fell on higher-than-average volume, breaking major moving average support. While fundamental news is sparse, the move suggests a large institutional holder is exiting. Momentum indicators have turned bearish, and the lack of immediate dip-buying interest indicates further downside to find value. Persistence is moderate as the sell-off appears more mechanical than news-driven. High SFRI makes it an easy short to execute.",2026-01-05,51.19,
20260105_113654,2026-01-05T11:36:54.000000,AFJK,67.5,2.7,8,Low Float Mean Reversion,"The stock has been trading at extreme premiums to its book value. Today's drop marks the beginning of a mean reversion. With a very low float, the DCL is high, but the Short Candidate Score is dampened by extreme borrow costs and squeeze risk. This is a high-risk short where the downside is likely but execution is difficult. Uncertainty is high due to potential for manipulated price action.",2026-01-05,66.8,81.848
20260105_113654,2026-01-05T11:36:54.000000,ASPC,56.5,1.13,9,Redemption Volatility,"As a SPAC, the drop follows the removal of the redemption floor or an extension vote outcome. These drops are typically permanent as the trust value is re-priced. Downside persistence is limited once the stock hits its new floor (often near $10, though currently much higher). Hard-to-borrow status makes this a poor short candidate despite high continuation likelihood. Low confidence due to opaque SPAC sponsor actions.",2026-01-05,19.51,15.8
20260105_113654,2026-01-05T11:36:54.000000,ESHA,56.5,1.13,10,Redemption Volatility,"Similar to ASPC, ESHA is experiencing the 'SPAC cliff' where investors redeem shares, leaving a low-float shell that trades with extreme volatility. While the move is down, the borrow is non-existent for most retail traders. Downside may continue toward $10 but the risk/reward for shorting is poor due to the 100%+ borrow rates. Fundamental support is entirely absent. Price is nearing the $15 constraint threshold.",2026-01-05,15.01,14.76
